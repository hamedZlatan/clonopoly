clonopoly
=========

Monopoly clone using SDL. Intended for Linux, but may work on other systems that support SDL 1.2.

This is basically for me to learn SDL.  Also programming in user space is more relaxing than kernel code, so this is
also theraputical.

I expect this will be playable in a few months (June 2014). 
The 'short term' goals are to be able to play a multiplayer (human vs human) game through to the end. As soon as that
is possible, I will call this version 1.0.

The 'long term' parts of the project include upgrading the graphics, upgrading the AI, and adding network support.
